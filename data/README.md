# Data Pre-processing

## Requirement

`StanfordCoreNLP` is required to obtain the dependency trees for all dataset. 

Please download version [3.9.2](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/history.html) and put the folder `stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05` under the current directory.

## Obtain the data

The pre-processed SemEval 2010 Task 8 English benchmark dataset is saved in ['semeval'](https://www.alipan.com/s/QqvzoNVj2Ci).

If you want to train on other datasets, please do the pre-processing in the format of sample_data and follow the script `data_processes.sh` to obtain the dependency trees for dataset.
